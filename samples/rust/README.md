## Sample Rust project

Most interesting for you here is not the source code, but configs in [`.mainframer`](.mainframer) folder.

This is a very common setup for Rust project (Cargo), but of course you might need to tune some ignore configs for your project.

### How to build

```bash
$ bash mainframer cargo build
```

Or any other Cargo task you want.

### Requirements

Rust installed on remote machine.
