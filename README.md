# mainframer

Tool that allows you to move build process from a local machine to a remote one.

Remote machine ought to be much faster than a laptop. 
With `mainframer` you can free up your local machine for better things â€”
like editing source code in your IDE without lags and
freezes, being able to actually _use_ your computer when the build is happening.

## Supported Actions

`mainframer` supports basically anything you can execute as a command.
It will sync files to remote machine, execute a command and sync files back.

We have quite a bunch of samples showing off some practical applications.
