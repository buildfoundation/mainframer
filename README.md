# Mainframer

Tool that allows you to move build process from a local machine to a remote one.

Remote machine ought to be much faster than a laptop. 
With `mainframer` you can free up your local machine for better things â€”
like editing source code in your IDE without lags and
freezes, being able to actually _use_ your computer when the build is happening.

## State of Project Development

Version `3.x` is in active development, the stable version is `2.x` and recommended for production use.

You can view `2.x` version sources and docs using [this Git tag](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/tree/v2.1.0).

There are lots of changes between `2.x` and `3.x`, but key subset is the following:

- Mainframer will work as system-wide CLI tool #[185](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/issues/185)
- Mainframer is now written in Rust #[191](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/issues/191)
- Mainframer will speed up most of existing workflows by syncing during remote command execution #[188](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/issues/188)

You can track `3.x` development progress using the [3.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/milestone/6).

## Supported Workflows

`mainframer` supports basically anything you can execute as a command.
It will sync files to remote machine, execute a command and sync files back.

We have quite a bunch of samples showing off some practical applications.

* [Gradle](samples/gradle)
* [Gradle Android](samples/gradle-android)
* [Rust](samples/rust)
* [Clang](samples/clang)
* [GCC](samples/gcc)
* [Maven](samples/mvn)
* [Buck](samples/buck)
* [Go](samples/go)

## Setup

## 3rd-party IntelliJ Mainframer Plugin

Guys from [@elpassion](https://github.com/elpassion) maintain [IntelliJ Plugin for Mainframer](https://github.com/elpassion/mainframer-intellij-plugin) that makes integration of Mainframer with any IntelliJ project better. 

We highly recommend the plugin if you use IntelliJ with Mainframer!
