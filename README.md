# mainframer

Script that allows you to move build process from a local machine to a remote one.

Remote machine ought to be much faster than a laptop. 
With `mainframer` you can free up your local machine for better things —
like editing source code in your IDE without lags and
freezes, being able to actually _use_ your computer when the build is happening.

## Supported Actions

`mainframer` supports basically anything you can execute as a command.
The script will sync files to remote machine, execute a command and sync files back.

We have quite a bunch of samples showing off some practical applications.

* [Gradle](samples/gradle)
* [Gradle Android](samples/gradle-android)
* [Rust](samples/rust)
* [Clang](samples/clang)
* [GCC](samples/gcc)
* [Maven](samples/mvn)
* [Buck](samples/buck)
* [Go](samples/go)

## Setup

* [Remote machine](docs/SETUP_REMOTE.md)
